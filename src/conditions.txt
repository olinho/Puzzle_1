Requirements:
a) Input:
- each line contains < 1000 characters
- up to 100 files
- files in one directory
- sum of lines from all input: 0 - 214.748.363
- sum of all characters = 214.748.363.000
1character = 8bits = 1Bajt
26.214.400 kB = 26.214 MB = 26GB?

Sollution:
Let's adjust requirements to reasonable size.
All lines = 1000
Files = 100
Each line contains 1000 characters
Sum of chars = 10^6
